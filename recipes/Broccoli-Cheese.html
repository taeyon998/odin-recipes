<h2> Description </h2> 

My mom made this broccoli cheese casserole every Thanksgiving when I was little. We kids could never get enough! If you have children or have some coming to visit you as guests this Thanksgiving, I guarantee that they will eat (and enjoy) this veggie dish. It's also fabulous with a Christmas ham. 

<h2> Ingredients </h2>  

<ul> 

<li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li> 

<li>1 cup mayonnaise</li> 

<li>1 egg, beaten</li> 

<li>Â¼ cup chopped onion</li> 

<li>3 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped broccoli</li> 

<li>8 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li> 

<li>salt and pepper to taste</li> 

</ul> 

<h2>Steps</h2>  

<ol> 

<li><b>Boil the noodles:</b> Boil the macaroni in salted water until the noodles are al dente. Drain and transfer to a prepared baking dish.</li> 

<li><b>Make the cheese sauce</b>: Melt butter, then whisk in the flour. Whisk in the milk, bring to a simmer, and stir in the cheeses. Season with salt and pepper and continue simmering until the sauce is thick. Pour the sauce over the noodles and stir.</li> 

<li><b>Make the topping:</b> Melt two tablespoons of butter in a skillet, add the bread crumbs, and toast until the crumbs are brown. Spread the topping over the macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li> 

<li><b>Bake the mac and cheese:</b> Bake in the preheated oven until the topping is golden brown.</li>
